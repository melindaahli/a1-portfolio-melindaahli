--Readme document for Melinda Li, melindxl@uci.edu--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, 
particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require 
it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at 
interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find 
them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. 
If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. 
But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is 
allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

*/10
- 1/1 Readme
- */2 Basic HTML content
- */1 Basic CSS styling
- */1 Advanced feature
- */2 Responsive layout
- */1 Passes validation checks
- */2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features (3+)
    [x] images with alt text
    [] headings and paragraph text
    [] multiple pages with navigation between them
    [x] links to external pages
    [x] semantic HTML tags
    [] custom icons

(b) CSS features (2+) 
    [] modifying padding & margins
    [] modifying links & (text) colors
    [] Bootstrap CSS helpers
    [] custom fonts with Google Fonts

(c) Advanced features (1+)
    [] more complex page layout with navigation bar
    [] embedded HTML5 media, like audio and videos WITH fallbacks
    [] using nested selectors to specify format
    [] contact form using HTML forms



3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an 
   accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.



4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?



5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, 
   or use of AI-based code completion)
